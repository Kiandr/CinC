\begin{abstract}
Lack of a precise index to identify degree of  haemorrhage prior cardiovascular collapse is being considered a driving cause of fatality in patients experiencing progressive haemorrhage. The traditional clinical haemorrhage assessment consists of conventional beat-to-beat heart rate and arterial blood pressure measurement. But, as shown in xx, prior cardiovascular collapses,  these indexes continue projecting no significant shift in their status. Hence, Convertino and Tavakolian have shown that SCG and PPG indeed provide such a window to alarm cardiovascular collapse prior radical projection on conventional measurements. Hence, As I shown in xxx, a mechanically flexible PPG sensor was designed and optimized for continuous monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory performance. But, the reliability of the this sensor for calcification of stages of haemorrhage, was not assessed. Thus, I aimed to resolve this issue,by conducting Lower Body Negative Pressure Test to stimulate haemorrhage in 10 awaked patients and compared the reliability of PPG signal captured from mechanically flexible sensor, where due to arterial blood loss in upper body was diminished, with conventional PPG captured from FDA approved pulse oximeter. Results from Bland and Altman analysis of  a minutes of PPG signal at -50 mm for 10 subjects were,

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{PhotoPlethysmography}
Many pulse oximetry technologies display a processed and filtered representation of the photoplethysmosgraphic waveform. Each manufacturer uses unique proprietary algorithms to calculate the waveform displayed on the pulse oximeter. Standard pulse oximetry utilises two wavelengths of light in the red and infrared spectrum. Unlike the red wavelength, the absorbance of the infrared (IR) signal is relatively unaffected by changes in arterial oxygen saturation. Instead, the absorbance of the IR signal changes with the pulsations associated with blood volume in the peripheral vascular bed at the sensor site. With each heartbeat, the ventricle pumps blood into the periphery, increasing the pulse pressure in the arteries and arterioles and thus increasing the volume of blood under the sensor during systole. The reverse, decreases in pulse pressure and blood volume in the periphery, occursduring dystole.

The photoplethysmosgraphic waveform displayed on some pulse oximeters represents the highly processed and filtered, pulsatile component of the IR signal over time, and, therefore, provides an indirect measure of blood volume or pulsatile strength under the sensor. Initially the photoplethysmosgraphic waveform was found to be useful as a simple indicator of the pulse oximeter signal integrity and changes in perfusion. Since then, clinicians have used the waveform display in a number of unique ways to obtain information on the physiological status of their patients. Clinicians observed, for example, that respiratory induced variations in the waveform amplitude (referred to as ∆POP) resemble the cyclical changes in pulse pressure and pulse volume that occur during the respiratory cycle, as measured with an arterial catheter (Figure 1). This is because the pumping action of the heart is directly influenced by relative changes in airway (intrapleural) pressure and blood pressure/blood volume.\cite{barach2000pulsus}

\section{Respiration Induced Intensity RIIV}
Based on the LBNP research, it is obvious that respiratory effort (Respiration Induved Intensity Veriation) is being observed during LBNP.

\section{Pleth Veriablity Index}
PVI, a measurement  that automatically and continuously calculates the respiratory variations in the photoplethysmogram from data collected noninvasively via a pulse oximetry sensor. PVI visually correlates with ∆POP34 but uses a different algorithm to calculate the PVI value. PVI is a measure of the dynamic changes in the Perfusion Index (PI) that occur during one or more complete respiratory cycles. PI reflects the amplitude of the pulse oximeter waveform and is calculated as the pulsatile infrared signal (AC or variable component), indexed against the non-pulsitile infrared signal (DC or constant component). The infrared signal is used because it is less affected by changes in arterial saturation than the red signal.

Part of the PPG signal was reduced as the blood perfusion changed in the peripheral tissue, and thus the amplitude of the signal changes. The aptitude of the PPG signal ini figure 6, is a filtered and amplified PPG signal, thus the amplitude of this signal does no correspond to the intra arterial pressure.  }
